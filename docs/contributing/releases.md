# Releases — Versioning, Shipping, Changelog, Migrations

Everything related to cutting a release: the five files that carry the version (with the mandatory `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` format), pre- and post-ship requirements, the CHANGELOG voice and `## To take advantage of v[version]` self-repair block, and when a release needs a version migration file under `skills/migrations/`.

This doc is the source of truth for the `/ship` skill and any human cutting a release.

---

## Version locations (single source of truth: `VERSION` file)

Every release advances the version in **five files at once**. Keep these in
sync. `/ship` enforces this via Step 12's idempotency check (VERSION vs
package.json drift), but the canonical list lives here so future runs and
the auto-update agent know where to look.

**Version format is mandatory: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` (four numeric
segments, dot-separated, no leading `v`).** Every new release MUST use the
4-segment form. The `.MICRO` slot is the dot-suffix follow-up channel: when
a release ships its commit subject ahead of its VERSION bump (e.g. PR #795
landing as `v0.31.4` without bumping the file), the corrective ship lands
as `0.31.4.1` rather than churning the patch number to `0.31.5`. Suffixes
like `-fixwave` are still allowed as needed (`0.31.1.1-fixwave`), but the
four numeric segments are required first. Historical 3-segment versions
(`0.31.3`, `0.22.1`) remain valid in `git log` and migration filenames
(`skills/migrations/v0.21.0.md`); do NOT rewrite them. Going forward only.

**Required (every release must update all five):**

| File | What lives there | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `VERSION` | The single source of truth. Read first by `/ship`, the binary, and CI version-gate. | Bare 4-segment string `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` (e.g. `0.31.4.1`), no leading `v`. |
| `package.json` | Bun/npm package version. `gbrain --version` reads it via the compiled binary's bundled package metadata. CI version-gate cross-checks this against `VERSION` and fails if they drift. | `"version": "0.31.4.1"` |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Top entry header `## [0.31.4.1] - YYYY-MM-DD` plus the "To take advantage of v0.31.4.1" block. | Standard Keep-a-Changelog header. |
| `TODOS.md` | Any TODO entries that mention "follow-up from vX.Y.Z.W" use the version of the release that filed them. Update only when filing NEW follow-up TODOs. | Inline `vX.Y.Z.W` references in TODO bodies. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | The Key Files section's per-file annotations carry `vX.Y.Z.W (#NNN)` tags noting which release introduced a behavior. Update whenever a wave's annotations get folded in. | Inline `vX.Y.Z.W (#NNN, contributed by @user)` references. |

**Auto-derived (no manual edit; refreshed by their own commands):**

- `bun.lock` — root-package version is auto-pinned from `package.json`. After
  bumping `package.json`, run `bun install` to refresh the lockfile.
- `llms-full.txt` / `llms.txt` — auto-generated documentation bundles. **Any
  CLAUDE.md edit MUST be followed by `bun run build:llms` in the same commit
  (or a follow-up commit before push).** The committed bundles are checked
  against fresh generator output by `test/build-llms.test.ts`, which runs in
  CI shard 1. If you edited CLAUDE.md and didn't regenerate, CI will fail.
  This has bitten the wave 3 times — every CLAUDE.md edit gets a `bun run
  build:llms` chaser, no exceptions. (The `verify` gate doesn't run this
  test; only the full unit suite does. So `bun run typecheck` clean is NOT
  enough to know you can push after a CLAUDE.md edit.)

**Historical (DO NOT bump on release):**

- `skills/migrations/v0.21.0.md` — migration files use the version they
  shipped FROM as their filename. v0.21.0's migration always says v0.21.0.
- `src/commands/migrations/v0_21_0.ts` — same: migration code references
  the schema version it migrates to.
- `test/migrations-v0_21_0.test.ts`, `test/migration-orchestrator-v0_21_0.test.ts`,
  `test/migrate.test.ts` — migration tests reference historical migration
  versions; these are correct as-is and should not move.
- `src/core/db.ts`, `src/core/migrate.ts`, `src/core/import-file.ts`,
  `src/commands/reindex-code.ts` — code comments cite the release that
  introduced a feature. Once written, these are historical record.
- `README.md` — references the latest published feature names by version
  (e.g. "v0.21.0 Code Cathedral"); update only when the README's marketing
  copy is intentionally being refreshed, NOT on every micro/patch bump.

**The /ship workflow's version idempotency check:** Step 12 reads
`VERSION` and `package.json`, classifies as FRESH / ALREADY_BUMPED /
DRIFT_STALE_PKG / DRIFT_UNEXPECTED, and refuses to proceed on
DRIFT_UNEXPECTED. This is why the two must move together.

**The CI version-gate** rejects pushes where `VERSION` and
`package.json` disagree, OR where `VERSION` is not strictly greater
than master's VERSION. If a queue collision claims your version on
master before yours lands, /ship's queue-aware allocator (Step 12)
will detect drift and re-bump on the next run.

### Mandatory version-consistency audit (run after EVERY merge or commit that touches VERSION, package.json, or CHANGELOG)

**The trio MUST agree.** Every merge from master will hit conflicts on
VERSION + package.json + CHANGELOG.md because master ships its own
version bumps. Auto-merge sometimes resolves these silently in unexpected
ways. After any merge, branch update, or version-related edit, run this
audit. It's three lines and never lies:

```bash
echo "VERSION:     $(cat VERSION)"
echo "package.json: $(node -e 'process.stdout.write(require("./package.json").version)')"
grep -E "^## \[" CHANGELOG.md | head -1
```

All three MUST show the same `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO`. If any one
disagrees, you have not finished the merge. Fix it before pushing or
shipping. There is no situation in which "I'll fix it next push" is OK,
because:

- A green local test run with mismatched VERSION/package.json still
  fails the CI version-gate.
- A green CHANGELOG entry under the wrong version header silently lies
  to release-notes consumers.
- /ship's Step 12 idempotency check classifies a mismatch as
  `DRIFT_UNEXPECTED` and HALTS — but only if you remember to run /ship
  before pushing. Manual `git push` skips the check.

### Merge-conflict recovery procedure (memorize this)

When `git merge origin/master` reports conflicts on VERSION,
package.json, or CHANGELOG.md, resolve in this exact order:

1. **VERSION** — overwrite with the wave's version (`echo -n "X.Y.Z.W"
   > VERSION`). Highest semver wins; do NOT take master's lower version.
2. **package.json** — strip the conflict markers, keep the wave's
   version line. Sed pattern:
   `sed -i.bak '/^<<<<<<< HEAD$/d; /^=======$/,/^>>>>>>> /d' package.json && rm package.json.bak`
   (assumes ours is above the `=======`).
3. **CHANGELOG.md** — strip ALL three conflict markers; both your entry
   and master's entry stay. Sed pattern:
   `sed -i.bak '/^<<<<<<< HEAD$/d; /^=======$/d; /^>>>>>>> origin\/master$/d' CHANGELOG.md && rm CHANGELOG.md.bak`
   Then verify your entry is the topmost `## [X.Y.Z.W]` and master's
   newer-than-yours entries (if any) sit below.
4. **Run the 3-line audit above.** If it doesn't show your version on
   all three lines, you missed a marker.
5. **Run `bun install`** to refresh `bun.lock` against the resolved
   `package.json`. Stage and commit if it changed.
6. **Run `bun run typecheck`** before committing the merge.
7. Only THEN run `git commit` for the merge.

If the audit shows drift after step 4, do NOT proceed to step 5. Re-run
steps 1-3 against the actual file content; you missed a marker or
resolved one in the wrong direction.

**Anti-pattern to avoid:** Resolving via `git checkout --ours package.json`
and `git checkout --theirs scripts/test-shard.sh` mixed in the same
commit. The selective directional resolution is fine, but on
VERSION/package.json/CHANGELOG specifically, ALWAYS use the explicit
`echo > VERSION` + sed-strip-markers pattern above. The directional
checkout flags have bitten us when the conflict shape was unexpected
(e.g. master stripped a section we expected to keep).

### Pre-push gate (manual; tighten when you remember to)

Before any `git push` of a merge commit, run the audit one more time:

```bash
echo "VERSION:     $(cat VERSION)"
echo "package.json: $(node -e 'process.stdout.write(require("./package.json").version)')"
grep -E "^## \[" CHANGELOG.md | head -1
```

If you've been editing the branch via `/ship` you can rely on Step 12's
idempotency check. If you've been editing manually (merge resolution,
conflict fix, version bump), the audit is the last line of defense
before CI yells at you.

## Pre-ship requirements

Before shipping (/ship) or reviewing (/review), always run the full test suite.
Two equivalent paths:

**Path A — local CI gate (recommended, v0.23.1+):**
- `bun run ci:local` runs the entire stack inside Docker: gitleaks (host), unit
  tests with `DATABASE_URL` unset, and all 29 E2E files sequentially against a
  fresh pgvector container. Stronger than PR CI's 2-file Tier 1 set; closer to
  what nightly Tier 1 catches. Spins up + tears down postgres automatically via
  `docker-compose.ci.yml`. Override the host port with
  `GBRAIN_CI_PG_PORT=5435 bun run ci:local` if 5434 collides.
- `bun run ci:local:diff` runs only the E2E files matched by the diff selector
  (`scripts/select-e2e.ts`), falling back to all 29 on unmapped src/ paths or
  schema/skills/package.json changes. Fast iteration during a focused branch.

**Path B — manual lifecycle (still supported):**
- `bun test` — unit tests (no database required)
- Follow the "E2E test DB lifecycle" steps above to spin up the test DB,
  run `bun run test:e2e`, then tear it down.

Both must pass. Do not ship with failing E2E tests. Do not skip E2E tests.

**Always run typecheck before pushing.** `bun test` (the bun runner)
skips TypeScript type checking — it only enforces runtime behavior.
Three ways to actually gate on types:

1. `bun run test` (npm script in `package.json`) — includes `bun run typecheck`
   plus the four shell pre-checks (`check-jsonb-pattern.sh`,
   `check-progress-to-stdout.sh`, `check-trailing-newline.sh`,
   `check-wasm-embedded.sh`) before the runner. Use this mid-branch.
2. `bun run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` standalone. Fast (~5s on this repo).
3. `bun run ci:local` — the full local CI gate from Path A.

The trap is: writing a new test, running `bun test test/foo.test.ts`,
seeing it pass, pushing — and CI's separate typecheck stage rejects an
invalid type literal that the runner accepted. Caught one of these
shipping the v0.23.2 round-trip E2E (`type: 'reflection'` is not a
member of `PageType`). Run `bun run typecheck` once before push, even
when only test files changed.

## Post-ship requirements (MANDATORY)

After EVERY /ship, you MUST run /document-release. This is NOT optional. Do NOT
skip it. Do NOT say "docs look fine" without running it. The skill reads every .md
file in the project, cross-references the diff, and updates anything that drifted.

If /ship's Step 8.5 triggers document-release automatically, that counts. But if
it gets skipped for ANY reason (timeout, error, oversight), you MUST run it manually
before considering the ship complete.

Files that MUST be checked on every ship:
- README.md — does it reflect new features, commands, or setup steps?
- CLAUDE.md — does it reflect new files, test files, or architecture changes?
- CHANGELOG.md — does it cover every commit?
- TODOS.md — are completed items marked done?
- docs/ — do any guides need updating?

A ship without updated docs is an incomplete ship. Period.

## CHANGELOG + VERSION are branch-scoped

**VERSION and CHANGELOG describe what THIS branch adds vs master, not how we got
here.** Every feature branch that ships gets its own version bump and CHANGELOG
entry. The entry is product release notes for users; it is not a log of internal
decisions, review rounds, or codex findings.

**Write the CHANGELOG entry at /ship time, not during development.** Mid-branch
iterations, review rounds (CEO/Eng/Codex/DX), and implementation detours belong
in the plan file at `~/.claude/plans/`, not in the CHANGELOG. One unified entry
per branch, covering what the branch added vs the base branch.

**Never edit a CHANGELOG entry that already landed on master.** If master has
v0.18.2 and your branch adds features, bump to the next version (v0.19.0, not
editing master's v0.18.2). When merging master into your branch, master may
bring new CHANGELOG entries above yours — push your entry above master's
latest and verify:

- Does CHANGELOG have your branch's own entry separate from master's entries?
- Is VERSION higher than master's VERSION?
- Is your entry the topmost `## [X.Y.Z]` entry?
- `grep "^## \[" CHANGELOG.md` shows a contiguous version sequence?

If any answer is no, fix it before continuing.

**CHANGELOG is for users, not contributors.** Write like product release notes:

- Lead with what the user can now **do** that they couldn't before. Sell the capability.
- Plain language, not implementation details. "You can now..." not "Refactored the..."
- **Never mention internal artifacts**: plan file IDs, decision tags (D-CX-#, F-ENG-#),
  review rounds, codex findings, subcontractor credits. These are invisible to users.
- Put contributor-facing changes in a separate `### For contributors` section at the bottom.
- Every entry should make someone think "oh nice, I want to try that."

**What to omit:**
- "Codex caught X that the CEO review missed" — private process detail.
- "D-CX-3 split errors/warnings" — tag is meaningless to users; name the feature instead.
- "Fix-wave PR #N supersedes #M" — supersede chains belong in PR bodies, not release notes.
- "215 new cases, 3 decisions applied, 7 reviews cleared" — these are planning-mode metrics.

**What to keep:**
- The user-facing change: what commands exist now, what flag was added, what behavior fixed.
- Numbers that mean something to the user: TTHW, commands that timed out before, detection counts.
- Upgrade instructions: `gbrain upgrade` + any manual step if needed.
- Credit to external contributors when a community PR was incorporated.

## CHANGELOG voice + release-summary format

Every version entry in `CHANGELOG.md` MUST start with a release-summary section in
the GStack/Garry voice — one viewport's worth of prose + tables that lands like a
verdict, not marketing. The itemized changelog (subsections, bullets, files) goes
BELOW that summary, separated by a `### Itemized changes` header.

The release-summary section gets read by humans, by the auto-update agent, and by
anyone deciding whether to upgrade. The itemized list is for agents that need to
know exactly what changed.

### Release-summary template

Use this structure for the top of every `## [X.Y.Z]` entry:

1. **Two-line bold headline** (10-14 words total) ... should land like a verdict, not
   marketing. Sound like someone who shipped today and cares whether it works.
2. **Lead paragraph** (3-5 sentences) ... what shipped, what changed for the user.
   Specific, concrete, no AI vocabulary, no em dashes, no hype.
3. **A "The X numbers that matter" section** with:
   - One short setup paragraph naming the source of the numbers (real production
     deployment OR a reproducible benchmark ... name the file/command to run).
   - A table of 3-6 key metrics with BEFORE / AFTER / Δ columns.
   - A second optional table for per-category breakdown if relevant.
   - 1-2 sentences interpreting the most striking number in concrete user terms.
4. **A "What this means for [audience]" closing paragraph** (2-4 sentences) tying
   the metrics to a real workflow shift. End with what to do.

Voice rules:
- No em dashes (use commas, periods, "...").
- No AI vocabulary (delve, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, fundamental, etc.) or
  banned phrases ("here's the kicker", "the bottom line", etc.).
- Real numbers, real file names, real commands. Not "fast" but "~30s on 30K pages."
- Short paragraphs, mix one-sentence punches with 2-3 sentence runs.
- Connect to user outcomes: "the agent does ~3x less reading" beats "improved
  precision."
- Be direct about quality. "Well-designed" or "this is a mess." No dancing.

Source material to pull from:
- CHANGELOG.md previous entry for prior context
- Latest `gbrain-evals/docs/benchmarks/[latest].md` for headline numbers (sibling repo)
- Recent commits (`git log <prev-version>..HEAD --oneline`) for what shipped
- Don't make up numbers. If a metric isn't in a benchmark or production data, don't
  include it. Say "no measurement yet" if asked.

Target length: ~250-350 words for the summary. Should render as one viewport.

### "To take advantage of v[version]" block (required, v0.13+)

After the release-summary and BEFORE `### Itemized changes`, every `## [X.Y.Z]`
entry MUST include a human-readable self-repair block under the heading
`## To take advantage of v[version]`.

Why: `gbrain upgrade` runs `gbrain post-upgrade` which runs `gbrain apply-migrations`.
This chain has a known weak link — `upgrade.ts` catches post-upgrade failures as
best-effort (so the binary still works). When that chain silently fails, users end
up with half-upgraded brains. The self-repair block gives them a paste-ready
recovery path; the v0.13+ `~/.gbrain/upgrade-errors.jsonl` trail + `gbrain doctor`
integration close the loop.

Template (adapt the verify commands per release):

```markdown
## To take advantage of v[version]

`gbrain upgrade` should do this automatically. If it didn't, or if `gbrain doctor`
warns about a partial migration:

1. **Run the orchestrator manually:**
   ```bash
   gbrain apply-migrations --yes
   ```
2. **Your agent reads `skills/migrations/v[version].md` the next time you interact with it.**
   [One sentence on whether headless agents need manual action, or whether the
   orchestrator already handled the mechanical side.]
3. **Verify the outcome:**
   ```bash
   [release-specific verify commands, e.g. `gbrain graph ... --depth 2`]
   gbrain stats
   ```
4. **If any step fails or the numbers look wrong,** please file an issue:
   https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/issues with:
   - output of `gbrain doctor`
   - contents of `~/.gbrain/upgrade-errors.jsonl` if it exists
   - which step broke

   This feedback loop is how the gbrain maintainers find fragile upgrade paths. Thank you.
```

**Skip this block** for patches that are pure bug fixes with zero user-facing action
(rare). If the release has a schema migration, data backfill, or new feature the
user needs to verify, the block is required.

The v0.13.0 entry in CHANGELOG.md is the canonical example.

### Itemized changes (the existing rules)

Below the release summary, write `### Itemized changes` and continue with the
detailed subsections (Knowledge Graph Layer, Schema migrations, Security hardening,
Tests, etc.). Same rules as before:

- Lead with what the user can now DO that they couldn't before
- Frame as benefits and capabilities, not files changed or code written
- Make the user think "hell yeah, I want that"
- Bad: "Added GBRAIN_VERIFY.md installation verification runbook"
- Good: "Your agent now verifies the entire GBrain installation end-to-end, catching
  silent sync failures and stale embeddings before they bite you"
- Bad: "Setup skill Phase H and Phase I added"
- Good: "New installs automatically set up live sync so your brain never falls behind"
- **Always credit community contributions.** When a CHANGELOG entry includes work from
  a community PR, name the contributor with `Contributed by @username`. Contributors
  did real work. Thank them publicly every time, no exceptions.

### Reference: v0.12.0 entry as canonical example

The v0.12.0 entry in CHANGELOG.md is the canonical example of the format. Match its
structure for every future version: bold headline, lead paragraph, "numbers that
matter" with BrainBench-style before/after table, "what this means" closer, then
`### Itemized changes` with the detailed sections below.

## Version migrations

Create a migration file at `skills/migrations/v[version].md` when a release
includes changes that existing users need to act on. The auto-update agent
reads these files post-upgrade (Section 17, Step 4) and executes them.

**You need a migration file when:**
- New setup step that existing installs don't have (e.g., v0.5.0 added live sync,
  existing users need to set it up, not just new installs)
- New SKILLPACK section with a MUST ADD setup requirement
- Schema changes that require `gbrain init` or manual SQL
- Changed defaults that affect existing behavior
- Deprecated commands or flags that need replacement
- New verification steps that should run on existing installs
- New cron jobs or background processes that should be registered

**You do NOT need a migration file when:**
- Bug fixes with no behavior changes
- Documentation-only improvements (the agent re-reads docs automatically)
- New optional features that don't affect existing setups
- Performance improvements that are transparent

**The key test:** if an existing user upgrades and does nothing else, will their
brain work worse than before? If yes, migration file. If no, skip it.

Write migration files as agent instructions, not technical notes. Tell the agent
what to do, step by step, with exact commands. See `skills/migrations/v0.5.0.md`
for the pattern.
